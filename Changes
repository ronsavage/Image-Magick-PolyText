Revision history for Perl extension Image::Magick::PolyText.

2.00  2017-01-08T08:36:00
	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
	- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.
	- Adopt new repo structure. See
		http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
	- Adopt sane version numbering.
	- Switch from Class::Std to Moo.
	- The switch to Moo means params to methods are assumed to be hashes, not hashrefs any more.
		Hence the jump in V from 1.0.3 to 2.00.
