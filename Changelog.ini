[V 2.00]
Date=2017-01-08T08:36:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.
- Adopt new repo structure. See
http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
- Adopt sane version numbering.
- Switch from Class::Std to Moo.
- The switch to Moo means params to methods are assumed to be hashes, not hashrefs any more.
Hence the jump in V from 1.0.3 to 2.00.
